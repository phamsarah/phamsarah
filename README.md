### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sarah! This is my story that I would like to share
I am from the small town Spanish Fort, Alabama. I have always been immersed in video games and would, unhealthily, spend 
around 18 hours a day. Eventually I made my own overpowered gaming pc in highschool... only for the purpose to get better 
at games :sweat_smile:  I got in trouble a lot for spending too much time on my computer, so that's when I knew I HAD to 
make it a career (so now I literally cannot get in trouble). 

I went to the closest college that was NOT in Alabama (because who likes being so close to home?), which was the
University of West Florida. I met some amazing people, lifelong friends, and insanely underpaid, caring professors. I
realized somewhere in my sophomore year that I was BEHIND! Not academically, but experience-wise. It felt like a big
slap in the face. I had no idea other students in CS were actually getting Google internships the moment they 
graduated highschool. I had no experience (besides school assignments) and had no idea what I actually wanted to do!
I just thought I would go into game development, but what does that even mean? How does one even start? I assumed
that job offers would just rain the moment I graduated just because I had a software degree. WRONG. 

So I got involved. I joined the university CodeFest/Hackathon, met some amazing people, coded for 3 straight days and we won
first place. Small battle, but it meant so much to me and killed the mentality of "well I'm not experienced enough". 
Soon after, I responded to a professor's email regarding a summer internship doing Android app development, and told him
I was interested. Got a letter of recommendation from a professor and the dean of CS, and got accepted into the 
internship! Everyday that summer I learned Android for the first time and worked on an app for nurses in training while
being a full-time student. Then I decided my journey at UWF was coming to an end.

I transferred to Auburn University my junior year and immediately joined all the CS extracurricular groups. I also immediately
applied to a local app development job for an Android position I saw posted on Handshake. I went through the coding
interview and showed them my app from my last internship and I received an offer letter a few weeks later! On the side, 
I had gotten involved with Google Developers Group and became an organizer teaching and hosting monthly tech events
that were on campus (and advocator for women in STEM). I worked as an Android developer for two years and learned SO
much. I had already released 100+ apps to the appstore, gotten hands-on experience coding the native Android featureset,
and worked with an Agile app development process, plus I worked alongside a team! 

Before my last semester at Auburn University, I decided to start venturing for a new job. I interviewed with many, many
companies but that's when TradeStation found me. I had already 2 years of industry experience and had a passion for software. 
So I interviewed with the team, loved the culture (remote work, high salary, cryptocurrency, stock exchanges ... everything
I love!), and received an offer the same day! Everyday since I started my software career, I had been worried that I would 
never find a job, but I did everything I could to prevent that from happening. Getting involved really, really matters. 
Even if you do not have the time, make time. Because people make time for the things they love. And companies want to hire 
people who love what they do. 

I think about this often, I would not have gotten my first internship if it wasn't for the CodeFest. If it wasn't for the
internship, I wouldn't have gotten my first app development job (they hired me for my experience). If I did not get my first
job, I definitely would not be where I am today. And I am so, so grateful for the people who believed in me and made this
happen. My story sounds like it may have been a breeze, but trust me there were many many "rock-bottom" moments. I'm
sure any CS/SE student at Auburn would agree with me.

Moral of the story, if your parental guardian is constantly getting mad at you for having fun, turn the fun into a career.
(no I do not play video games as a career, but at least I get to sit at a computer and get paid!)
