### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sarah! This is my story that I would like to share
I am from the small town of Spanish Fort, Alabama. I have always been immersed in video games and would spend 
around 18 hours a day. In highschool, I built an overpowered gaming pc and was live streaming my gaming! 
However, I got in a lot of trouble for spending too much time on my computer, so that's when I knew I HAD to 
make it a career. 

Fast forward to the University of West Florida. I met some amazing people, lifelong friends, and insanely skillful and 
caring professors. I realized somewhere in my sophomore year that I had no software engineering experience! 

So I got involved. I joined the university Hackathon and met some amazing people. We programmed a Chrome extension
browser that would determine any articles reliability factor in terms of biase using machine learning. We did not stop
programming for 3 days and then we won first place. Small battle, but it meant so much to me and killed the imposter syndrome
mentality. 

Soon after, I received an email from my professor regarding a summer internship working on an Android app. I told him
I was interested, provided him a letter of recommendation from a professor and the dean, and got accepted into the 
internship! Everyday that summer I worked alongside a local hospital to program an Android app for simulation training
for nurses.

Junior year, I transferred to Auburn University and joined all the extracurricular Computer Science groups. I also
applied to a local app development job for an Android developer role on Handshake. I went through the coding
interview and showed them my app from my last internship and received an offer letter a few weeks later! On the side, 
I had gotten involved with Google Developers Group and became an organizer teaching and hosting monthly tech events
that were on campus (and advocator for women in STEM). I worked as an Android developer for two years and learned SO
much. I had already released 100+ apps to the Google Play Store, gotten hands-on experience coding the native Android 
featureset, and worked with an Agile app development process, plus I worked alongside a team! 

Before my last semester at Auburn University, TradeStation reached out to me. I had already 2 years of industry experience 
and had a passion for software. So I interviewed with the team, loved the culture (remote work, high salary, cryptocurrency, 
stock exchanges ... everything I love!), and received an offer the same day!

Now I work at Block as a Android Engineer for the Customer Foundations team!

I think about this often, I would not have gotten my first internship if it wasn't for the Hackathon. If it wasn't for the
internship, I wouldn't have gotten my first app development job. If I did not get my first job, I would not be where I am 
today. And because of that I am so, so grateful for the people who believed in me and helped me reach my goals.
